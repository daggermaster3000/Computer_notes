The master-slave flip-flop eliminates all the timing problems by using two SR flip-flops connected together in a series configuration. One flip-flop acts as the “Master” circuit, which triggers on the leading edge of the clock pulse while the other acts as the “Slave” circuit, which triggers on the falling edge of the clock pulse. This results in the two sections, the master section and the slave section being enabled during opposite half-cycles of the clock signal.
