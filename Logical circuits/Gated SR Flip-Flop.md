The input states will only influence the output when the clock $T$ is ON.
By connecting a 2-input AND gate in series with each input terminal of the SR Flip-flop a Gated SR Flip-flop can be created. This extra conditional input is called an “Enable” input

If Set or Reset change state while the enable (EN) input is high the correct latching action may not occur (caus of the metastable state)
