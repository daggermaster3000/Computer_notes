### Acquisition of measured variables

Digital input signals are read into the computer via a digital interface card, which can perform the following tasks: 
- Potential separation between experiment and computer 
- Level adjustment and signal regeneration 
- Synchronization of signal exchange 
- Data buffering, evaluation of signal edges 
- Counting (maximum counting frequency) of pulses
- Time measurement (resolution, stability of internal clock frequency)

Most measured quantities are analog in nature and must first be converted to a binary numerical value in order to be processed. This is done with the #ADC
