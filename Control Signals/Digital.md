Digital Signals are used to monitor and control values that are either on or off, or open or closed (run status of a motor, alarm status, etc.)

The connection is implemented via a digital output interface that performs the following tasks: 
- Potential separation between experiment
- computer Level adjustment ( e 0 .. 5 Vâ†’ -10 .. 10 V )
- Synchronization of signal exchange 
- Data buffering 
- Generating clock signals
