Analog control signals: Here the analog (i.e. continuous) value must be converted from the corresponding binary number representation in the computer, i.e. a digital-to-analog conversion must take place ( DAC = digital-to-analog converter ). 

The following properties are important for the use of a DAC: 
- Output voltage range
- Resolution
- Integral linearity, differential linearity 
- Zero point deviation 
- Duration of the setting time of a stable output value
- Time and temperature stability
