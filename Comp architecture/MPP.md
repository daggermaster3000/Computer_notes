Massively Parralel Processing

*Usually for vector processing*
[[SIMD]] Architecture
Use of [[GPU]]s

Graphics processors (GPUs) typically execute vector operations to extremely wide vectors called streams Especially adapted GPUs (GPGPUs) are used for MPP in High Performance Computing Application in simulations and computations such as Computational Fluid Dynamics, Quantum Chemistry, Machine Vision and AI applications with Deep Learning
