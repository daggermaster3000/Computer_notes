(Advanced [[RISC]] Machines) 
is a family of [reduced instruction set computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer "Reduced instruction set computer") (RISC) [instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture "Instruction set architecture") for [computer processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit"), configured for various environments.

Due to their low costs, minimal power consumption, and lower heat generation than their competitors, ARM processors are desirable for light, portable, battery-powered devices, including [smartphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone "Smartphone"), [laptops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop "Laptop") and [tablet computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer "Tablet computer"), and other [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system").However, ARM processors are also used for [desktops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer "Desktop computer") and [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)"), including the world's fastest [supercomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer "Supercomputer") ([Fugaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugaku_(supercomputer) "Fugaku (supercomputer)"))
