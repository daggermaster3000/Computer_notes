Modern computers are based on the stored program concept (opposite of [[fixed program computers]]). Here prorams and data are stored in separate units. The computer is therefore easy to reprogram.

It consists of 3 basic units:
#### 1. The CPU (central processing unit)
![[Pasted image 20221130104922.png]]
It is made up of:
**Control unit**
- Handles the control signals
- Directs input and output flows
- Fetches code for instructions
**Arithmetic and Logic Unit** #ALU
Handles 
- addition and subtractions 
- logical operations
- bit shifting
- arithmetics
- comparisons

#### 2. The main [[Memory]] unit (or registers)
Consists of:
- #Accumulator
- Program counter #PC
- Memory address register  #MAR
- Memory Data Register  #MDR
- Current Instruction Register  #CIR
- Instruction Buffer Register #IBR

#### 3. The input/output devices
Program or data is read into main memory from the _input device_ or secondary storage under the control of CPU input instruction. 
_Output devices_ are used to output the information from a computer. If some results are evaluated by computer and it is stored in the computer, then with the help of output devices, we can present them to the user.


## The bottleneck
Instructions can only be carried out sequentially and one at a time. The processor is idle for a certain amount of time while memory is accessed. This holds backs the performance of the #CPU.
