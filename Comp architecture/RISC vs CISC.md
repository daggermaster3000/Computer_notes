Both architectures are not discriminated by the number of instructions but
rather by the way of processing the instructions in a pipeline. As pipelines
work with a fixed number of steps, complex addressing modes are not
feasible except for load and store operations.

### CISC
Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)
Representatives: 6502, PDP11, VAX11, Intel x86
Often implementation of the Orthogonal Instruction Set

>Early 70s: Semantic gap; realization that most complex instructions were not or rarely used by compilers.
