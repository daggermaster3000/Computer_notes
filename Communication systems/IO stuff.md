## The interface
The IO interface is used as a method to transfer info between internal storage (memory) and external peripheral devices.

For Example: A keyboard and mouse provide Input to the computer are called input devices while a monitor and printer that provide output to the computer are called output devices. Just like the external hard-drives, there is also availability of some peripheral devices which are able to provide both input and output.
